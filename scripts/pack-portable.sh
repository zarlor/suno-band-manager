# Pack portable session files for multi-machine sync.
# Creates portable-sync.tar.gz in docs/ under the project root.
#
# This bundles the user-generated content that lives in docs/ — voice files,
# band profiles, songbook, WIP files — so it can move between machines
# without going through git.
#
# Usage: bash scripts/pack-portable.sh [project-root]
#   project-root defaults to current directory
#
# Customization:
#   Create portable-manifest.yaml at the project root to control which files
#   get packed. See portable-manifest.example.yaml for the format. Without a
#   manifest, the defaults below pack the documented Suno module data dirs.
#
# Windows: see scripts/pack-portable.ps1 for the PowerShell equivalent.
