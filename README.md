# BMad Suno Agent — Mac, the Band Manager

An AI-powered music production assistant that helps you create professional Suno-ready song packages through guided creative conversation. Mac orchestrates four specialized skills into a seamless workflow: from initial inspiration to a complete package — style prompt, lyrics, and parameter recommendations — that you can paste directly into Suno.

## Features

You talk to Mac like you'd talk to a producer. Tell Mac what kind of song you want — a genre, a mood, a poem, a feeling, a reference track — and Mac produces a complete package:

- **Style Prompt** — Model-specific, optimized for your chosen Suno model (v4.5-all, v5 Pro, etc.)
- **Structured Lyrics** — With Suno metatags (`[Verse]`, `[Chorus]`, etc.), rhythmic consistency, and cliché detection
- **Exclusion Prompt** — What Suno should avoid
- **Parameter Recommendations** — Slider values, vocal gender, persona references (tier-aware)
- **Wild Card Variant** — An experimental alternative to push creative boundaries

After you try the output on Suno, Mac helps you refine through a structured feedback loop — translating subjective reactions ("it doesn't feel right") into concrete parameter adjustments.

### Highlights

- **Three Interaction Modes** — Demo (quick and scrappy), Studio (deep customization), Jam (experimental)
- **Band Profiles** — Persistent sonic identity across songs (genre, vocal direction, style baseline, writer voice)
- **Writer Voice Preservation** — Analyzes your writing samples to maintain your authentic voice when transforming lyrics
- **Tier-Aware** — Knows what's available on Free, Pro, and Premier plans; never shows features you can't access
- **Feedback Loop** — Five-type feedback triage with guided elicitation for users who can't articulate what's wrong
- **Instrumental Support** — Dedicated workflow for instrumental-only tracks
- **Non-English Support** — Language detection with Suno-specific guidance
- **Memory System** — Remembers your preferences, musical patterns, and creative history across sessions

## Quick Start

1. **Invoke Mac** — Use the trigger phrase "talk to Mac," "Band Manager," or "create a song for Suno"
2. **Tell Mac what you want** — "Make me a sad indie folk song" or paste a poem
3. **Get your package** — Mac produces a complete style prompt + lyrics + parameters
4. **Try it on Suno** — Paste into Suno's Custom Mode fields
5. **Come back and refine** — Tell Mac what worked and what didn't

For detailed documentation on all features, interaction modes, band profiles, the feedback loop, direct skill access, and headless/automation modes, see the [Usage Guide](USAGE.md).

## Architecture

Mac is an orchestrating agent that coordinates four specialized skills:

```

                         └──────────────────┘
```

The orchestrating agent and each skill have their own documentation:

| Component | Purpose | Key Scripts |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| [**Mac (Band Manager)**](src/skills/bmad-suno-agent-band-manager/README.md) | Orchestrating agent — guides the full song creation workflow across all skills | `pre-activate.py`, `validate-path.py`, `check-memory-health.py` |
| [**Band Profile Manager**](src/skills/bmad-suno-band-profile-manager/README.md) | CRUD for band identity profiles, writer voice analysis, tier feature awareness | `validate-profile.py`, `list-profiles.py`, `tier-features.py`, `diff-profiles.py` |
| [**Style Prompt Builder**](src/skills/bmad-suno-style-prompt-builder/README.md) | Model-aware style prompt generation with creativity modes and wild card variants | `validate-prompt.py` |
| [**Lyric Transformer**](src/skills/bmad-suno-lyric-transformer/README.md) | Poem/text to Suno-ready structured lyrics with metatags and cliché detection | `validate-lyrics.py`, `cliche-detector.py`, `syllable-counter.py`, `analyze-input.py`, `section-length-checker.py`, `lyrics-diff.py` |
| [**Feedback Elicitor**](src/skills/bmad-suno-feedback-elicitor/README.md) | Post-generation feedback triage and guided refinement with musical vocabulary translation | `parse-feedback.py`, `map-adjustments.py` |

Each skill can be invoked directly for standalone use — see the linked READMEs for details, headless modes, and examples.

## Prerequisites

- **Claude Code** with a model that supports tool use (Claude Sonnet 3.5+, Claude Opus 4+)
- **BMad Method (BMB module)** installed — Mac is built as a BMad skill
- **Suno account** (free tier works; Pro/Premier unlocks additional features)

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zarlor/bmad-suno-band-manager
cd bmad-suno-band-manager
```

**Requires [BMad Method](https://github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD/) (v6.2.0+).**

1. Run the BMad installer:

```bash
npx bmad-method install
```

2. When prompted for custom modules, select **"Add new custom modules"** and provide the path to this module's `src/` directory.

3. The installer will ask you to configure:
   - **Suno tier** — Free, Pro, or Premier (determines available features)
   - **Default interaction mode** — Demo, Studio, or Jam
   - **Band profiles folder** — Where to store band identity files
   - **Songbook folder** — Where to store saved songs

4. The installer registers all skills with your IDE and creates the necessary directories.

5. On first activation, Mac will greet you and confirm your setup. All preferences are changeable anytime through conversation — just tell Mac "I upgraded to Pro" or "make Studio my default mode."

## Updating

To re-register skills after a module update (preserves your existing settings):

```bash
npx bmad-method install --action quick-update
```

For a full update that lets you review and change configuration:

```bash
npx bmad-method install --action update
```

## Suno Model Compatibility

Mac supports Suno models from v4 through v5 Pro, with model-specific prompt optimization and character limit enforcement. See the [Suno Reference](SUNO-REFERENCE.md) for the full model comparison, plan features, and style prompt best practices.
