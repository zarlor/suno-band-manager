# Suno Agent — Mac, the Band Manager

An AI-powered music production assistant that helps you create professional Suno-ready song packages through guided creative conversation. Mac orchestrates four specialized skills into a seamless workflow: from initial inspiration to a complete package — style prompt, lyrics, and parameter recommendations — that you can paste directly into Suno.

## Features

You talk to Mac like you'd talk to a producer. Tell Mac what kind of song you want — a genre, a mood, a poem, a feeling, a reference track — and Mac produces a complete package:

- **Style Prompt** — Model-specific, optimized for your chosen Suno model (v4.5-all, v5 Pro, etc.)
- **Structured Lyrics** — With Suno metatags (`[Verse]`, `[Chorus]`, etc.), rhythmic consistency, and cliché detection
- **Exclusion Prompt** — What Suno should avoid
- **Parameter Recommendations** — Slider values, vocal gender, persona references (tier-aware)
- **Wild Card Variant** — An experimental alternative to push creative boundaries

After you try the output on Suno, Mac helps you refine through a structured feedback loop — translating subjective reactions ("it doesn't feel right") into concrete parameter adjustments.

### Highlights

- **Three Interaction Modes** — Demo (quick and scrappy), Studio (deep customization), Jam (experimental)
- **Band Profiles** — Persistent sonic identity across songs (genre, vocal direction, style baseline, writer voice)
- **Writer Voice Preservation** — Analyzes your writing samples to maintain your authentic voice when transforming lyrics
- **Tier-Aware** — Knows what's available on Free, Pro, and Premier plans; never shows features you can't access
- **Feedback Loop** — Five-type feedback triage with guided elicitation for users who can't articulate what's wrong
- **Instrumental Support** — Dedicated workflow for instrumental-only tracks
- **Non-English Support** — Language detection with Suno-specific guidance
- **Memory System** — Remembers your preferences, musical patterns, and creative history across sessions

## Quick Start

1. **Invoke Mac** — Use the trigger phrase "talk to Mac," "Band Manager," or "create a song for Suno"
2. **Tell Mac what you want** — "Make me a sad indie folk song" or paste a poem
3. **Get your package** — Mac produces a complete style prompt + lyrics + parameters
4. **Try it on Suno** — Paste into Suno's Custom Mode fields
5. **Come back and refine** — Tell Mac what worked and what didn't

For detailed documentation on all features, interaction modes, band profiles, the feedback loop, direct skill access, and headless/automation modes, see the [Usage Guide](USAGE.md).

## Architecture

Mac is an orchestrating agent that coordinates four specialized skills:

```
                        ┌─────────────────────┐
                        │   Mac (Band Manager) │

                        └──────────┬──────────┘

                         ┌─────────┴────────┐
                         │ Feedback         │
                         │ Elicitor         │
                         └──────────────────┘
```

The orchestrating agent and each skill have their own documentation:

| Component | Purpose | Key Scripts |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| [**Mac (Band Manager)**](src/skills/suno-agent-band-manager/references/README.md) | Orchestrating agent — guides the full song creation workflow across all skills | `pre-activate.py`, `validate-path.py`, `check-memory-health.py` |
| [**Band Profile Manager**](src/skills/suno-band-profile-manager/references/README.md) | CRUD for band identity profiles, writer voice analysis, tier feature awareness | `validate-profile.py`, `list-profiles.py`, `tier-features.py`, `diff-profiles.py` |
| [**Style Prompt Builder**](src/skills/suno-style-prompt-builder/references/README.md) | Model-aware style prompt generation with creativity modes and wild card variants | `validate-prompt.py` |
| [**Lyric Transformer**](src/skills/suno-lyric-transformer/references/README.md) | Poem/text to Suno-ready structured lyrics with metatags and cliché detection | `validate-lyrics.py`, `cliche-detector.py`, `syllable-counter.py`, `analyze-input.py`, `section-length-checker.py`, `lyrics-diff.py` |
| [**Feedback Elicitor**](src/skills/suno-feedback-elicitor/references/README.md) | Post-generation feedback triage and guided refinement with musical vocabulary translation | `parse-feedback.py`, `map-adjustments.py` |

Each skill can be invoked directly for standalone use — see the linked READMEs for details, headless modes, and examples.

## Prerequisites

- **An LLM CLI with skill support** — Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Codex CLI, GitHub Copilot, Windsurf, or OpenCode
- **Suno account** (free tier works; Pro/Premier unlocks additional features)
- **BMad Method** (optional) — Mac was built with BMad and can be installed as a BMad module, but runs independently without it

### Optional: Audio Analysis

For objective audio measurements (BPM, key, energy, chord progressions, playlist sequencing), install:

```bash
pip install librosa numpy
```

These are optional — the full song creation and refinement workflow works without them. Mac will offer to help install if you try to use audio analysis features without them.

## Installation

### Standalone (any supported LLM CLI)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zarlor/suno-band-manager.git
cd suno-band-manager
./link-skills.sh
```

The link script creates symlinks in both `.claude/skills/` and `.agents/skills/` — the portable [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) standard supported by Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Codex CLI, GitHub Copilot, Windsurf, and OpenCode.

Then activate Mac using your LLM CLI's skill invocation (e.g., `/suno-agent-band-manager` in Claude Code). On first run, Mac walks you through setup — Suno tier, interaction mode, preferences.

### With BMad Method

If you use [BMad Method](https://github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD/) (v6.2.0+):

```bash
npx bmad-method@next install    # Install BMad if not already present
./link-skills.sh                # Link Suno skills
/suno-setup                # Configure via setup skill
```

BMad provides additional module infrastructure (config management, help system registration) but is not required for core functionality.

For detailed installation instructions including per-tool notes, standalone configuration, and troubleshooting, see [INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md).

### Start using Mac

On first activation, Mac will greet you and confirm your setup. All preferences are changeable anytime through conversation — just tell Mac "I upgraded to Pro" or "make Studio my default mode."

## Updating

### Updating the Suno module

```bash
git pull
```

That's it. Your symlinks point into `src/skills/`, so changes are picked up immediately. If the update includes new config options or a version bump, re-run setup to apply them:

```
/suno-setup
```

The setup skill detects your existing config and uses your saved values as defaults. Your preferences, band profiles, songbook, and memory are all preserved.

### After a BMad Method upgrade (BMad users only)

Running `npx bmad-method@next install` replaces the contents of `.claude/skills/` with BMad's own skills. This removes the Suno symlinks but does **not** affect your module source, config, or data. Your `.agents/skills/` symlinks are unaffected.

To restore:

```bash
./link-skills.sh          # Re-creates .claude/skills/ symlinks
/suno-setup          # Re-registers help entries if needed
```

## Multi-LLM Compatibility

Mac follows the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) open standard. The `link-skills.sh` script creates symlinks in `.agents/skills/` (the portable standard) alongside `.claude/skills/`:

| LLM CLI | Skill Discovery Path | Status |
|---------|---------------------|--------|
| Claude Code | `.claude/skills/`, `.agents/skills/` | Fully supported |
| Gemini CLI | `.agents/skills/`, `.gemini/skills/` | Compatible |
| Codex CLI | `.agents/skills/` | Compatible |
| GitHub Copilot | `.agents/skills/`, `.github/skills/` | Compatible |
| Windsurf | `.agents/skills/`, `.windsurf/skills/` | Compatible |
| OpenCode | `.agents/skills/`, `.opencode/skills/` | Compatible |
| Cursor | `.cursor/skills/` (copy, not symlink) | Manual setup required |

Mac was developed and tested primarily on Claude Code. Other LLM CLIs should work with the same SKILL.md format but may have differences in tool permissions, agent spawning, or skill activation UX.

## Suno Model Compatibility

Mac supports Suno models from v4 through v5.5 Pro, with model-specific prompt optimization and character limit enforcement. See the [Suno Reference](SUNO-REFERENCE.md) for models, plans, and prompting, and the [Studio & Editor Reference](STUDIO-EDITOR-REFERENCE.md) for post-generation editing (Legacy Editor, Studio, Stems, Warp Markers, and more).
