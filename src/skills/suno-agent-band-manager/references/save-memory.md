# Save Memory

Immediately persist the current session context to memory.

## Process

1. **Capture unsaved creative work** — Before saving memory, check the current conversation for creative fragments that haven't been written to files yet:
   - Brainstorming discussions that produced potential lyrics, images, or concepts for a song (even if the song doesn't have a name yet)
   - Working fragments, lines, or structural ideas that emerged from conversation
   - New WIP concepts that were discussed but never written to `docs/wip-*.md`
   
   If unsaved creative work is found, write it to a WIP file (`docs/wip-{working-title}-fragments.md`) BEFORE proceeding with the memory save. This ensures the portable sync archive captures everything. Surface what you're saving: "We had some creative fragments in our conversation that aren't on disk yet — let me save those to a WIP file before we pack up."

   **This step is critical for portable sync** — conversation content doesn't survive session boundaries or machine transitions. If it's not in a file, it's lost.

2. **Read current index.md** — Load existing context from `{project-root}/_bmad/_memory/band-manager-sidecar/index.md`

3. **Update with current session:**
   - Active song work (style prompt, lyrics, parameters, model, band profile in use)
   - User preferences discovered or changed this session
   - Current interaction mode preference
   - Any band profile updates pending
   - Production knowledge discovered (see Step 2b)
   - Next steps to continue

   ### Handoff Checkpoint (before writes)

   Before writing to any memory files, surface a brief summary of what will be saved:

   > "Here's what I'd save: **[2-4 bullet summary of changes to index.md, patterns.md, chronology.md]**. Sound right?"

   Wait for confirmation. The user may want to exclude something or add context. This is especially important for patterns.md where personal preferences are being recorded — the user should control what gets stored as a "pattern" about them.

   ### 2b. Production knowledge check

   After create-song or refine-song cycles, check for discoverable production patterns:
   - Repeated slider settings across successful songs ("You've used Weirdness 55 on your last 3 songs — want me to note that as your sweet spot?")
   - Genre term combinations that consistently landed
   - Metatag patterns that achieved intended effects
   - What settings/approaches led to first-generation success vs. iteration

   Store these in patterns.md under the Production Knowledge section — as the user's personal findings, not universal prescriptions.

4. **Write updated index.md** — Replace content with condensed, current version

5. **Checkpoint other files if needed (parallel batch)** — These writes are independent; run in parallel:
   - `patterns.md` — Add new musical preferences discovered (genre tendencies, vocal preferences, exclusion patterns, creativity level preferences) and production knowledge (see Step 3b)
   - `chronology.md` — Add session summary if significant work was done

6. **Companion files audit (bidirectional)** — If the user has a voice file, run both directions:

   **Forward (new files need entries):** Check whether any new `docs/` files were created during the session that aren't in the voice file's Companion Files table. If so, offer to add them: "I notice we created [file] this session — want me to add it to your companion files index?" Include: file path, one-line description, and when-to-load trigger phrase.

   **Reverse (stale entries in the table):** Check every entry in the Companion Files table:
   - Does the referenced file still exist on disk? If not, the entry is stale — offer to remove it (the file may have been deleted during this or a previous session without the table being updated)
   - Does the entry contain a stale count or description? (e.g., "34 tracks" when the playlist now has 36, or "The Slide — firearm metaphor..." when The Slide is now a published song with a songbook entry). If so, offer to update the description or move the entry to point at the authoritative file (e.g., the songbook entry instead of a deleted WIP file)
   - **Is the entry a WIP file that's now resolved?** If the Companion Files table includes a `docs/wip-*.md` entry, check whether the file has a `## STATUS: COMPLETED` marker at the top (see `./references/reconcile.md` → "The COMPLETED WIP convention"). If so, the entry is stale — offer to remove it from the table. Resolved WIPs are historical records, not active reference material, and don't belong in the "load on demand" companion files table.

   Present all findings in one handoff: "I checked the companion files table — here's what I found: [X new files to add, Y stale entries to remove, Z entries with outdated descriptions]. Want me to fix them all, review each, or skip?"

   **WIP completion scan (post-publication):** Additionally, if this session included publishing a song, scan `docs/wip-*.md` for any file whose content matches the published song but lacks the `## STATUS: COMPLETED` marker. If found, surface it: "I notice `docs/wip-X.md` looks like the source fragments for the song we just published. Mark it COMPLETED? (Load `./references/reconcile.md` → 'The COMPLETED WIP convention' for the marker format.)" Apply the marker if confirmed. This is the primary mechanism by which Layer 1 of the WIP-sync fix operates — catching WIP resolution at save-memory time is the backstop if `create-song.md` Step 7 missed it.

7. **Reference reconciliation check** — Before finalizing the save, do a quick consistency scan:
   - If any song titles, band profile names, or playlist orders changed during this session, load `./references/reconcile.md` and run reconciliation
   - Compare the values being written to index.md/chronology.md against what already exists in the voice context file and songbook — flag any inconsistencies
   - This step is fast (just a scan) and only triggers the full reconciliation handoff if stale references are actually found
   - If nothing changed this session, skip silently

## Output

Confirm save with a brief session recap in Mac's voice:

"Memory saved. Here's what we covered:
- {2-4 bullet points summarizing the session: songs created/refined, preferences discovered, profiles updated}
- Ready to pick up right here next time."

**When complete:** Return to the main menu or continue with the user's next request.
