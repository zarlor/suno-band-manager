# Band Profile Schema

## YAML Structure

```yaml
# Band Profile — {band_name}
# Created: {date}
# Last modified: {date}

name: "Band Name Here"
version: 1  # Increment on major sound evolution
instrumental: false  # true for instrumental-only projects (skips vocal requirements)

# Sound Identity
genre: "indie folk-rock with electronic textures"
mood: "melancholic but hopeful, atmospheric"
language: "English"  # Language for lyrics and style cues
reference_tracks:
  - "Bon Iver meets Radiohead"
  - "Fleet Foxes with Massive Attack production"

# Model & Tier
model_preference: "v4.5-all"  # v4.5-all | v4 Pro (legacy) | v4.5 Pro | v4.5+ Pro | v5 Pro | v5.5
tier: "free"                   # free | pro | premier

# Style Prompt — 1,000 char limit (v4.5+/v5/v5.5; 200 for v4 Pro). Front-load essentials in first ~200 chars (critical zone).
style_baseline: >
  Indie folk-rock with electronic textures, atmospheric and layered.
  Warm analog synths underneath acoustic guitar, subtle ambient pads.
  Modern production, wide stereo field, intimate mix.
exclusion_defaults:
  - "no autotune"
  - "no screaming"
  - "no heavy metal guitar"

# Vocal Direction (required unless instrumental: true)
vocal:
  gender: "male"           # male | female | nonbinary | any
  tone: "warm, breathy"
  delivery: "intimate, conversational"
  energy: "restrained, building"
  diction: "clear, slightly slurred on emotional peaks"
  persona_reference: ""    # Suno Persona name, if exists (v4.5/v5 only; replaced by voice_id in v5.5)
  persona_source_song: ""  # Song the Persona was derived from (for recreation)
  # NOTE: Personas pull the sound toward the era/style of the source song.
  # Audio Influence at 10-15% reduces this era-anchoring but doesn't fully
  # overcome it. For era-specific pieces, consider generating without a persona,
  # or creating era-specific personas from era-appropriate source songs.
  voice_id: ""             # Suno Voice identifier (v5.5, Pro/Premier only). Replaces persona_reference for v5.5.
  # NOTE: When voice_id is set, omit gender vocal descriptors from style_baseline —
  # the Voice defines the vocal identity (gender, tone, character from the audio sample).

# Creative Settings
creativity_default: "balanced"  # conservative | balanced | experimental

# Sliders (pay-gated — only set if tier supports them)
sliders:
  weirdness: 50            # 0-100, default 50
  style_influence: 50      # 0-100, default 50
  audio_influence: null     # 0-100, only when using audio upload

# Studio Preferences (Premier tier only)
studio_preferences:
  bpm: null                # Default tempo (number)
  key: ""                  # Default key/scale (e.g., "C minor", "A major")
  time_signature: ""       # Default time signature (e.g., "4/4", "3/4")

# Custom Model (v5.5, Pro/Premier only)
custom_model_id: ""        # Suno Custom Model identifier, if user has one
custom_model_notes: ""     # What the custom model was trained on and what production style it provides

# Writer Voice (optional — populated by Analyze Writer Voice)
writer_voice:
  vocabulary: ""           # formal/casual, abstract/concrete, domain words
  rhythm: ""               # sentence length patterns, fragment use
  imagery: ""              # dominant image worlds (nature, urban, body, etc.)
  emotional_tone: ""       # raw/restrained, hopeful/melancholic, etc.
  metaphor_style: ""       # extended/quick, conventional/surprising, frequency
  repetition_patterns: ""  # anaphora, refrains, echo structures
  sample_quotes: []        # representative lines from analyzed samples

# Known Working Prompt Patterns (optional — prompt formulations that reliably produce good results)
known_working_patterns: []
  # Per-profile list of prompt patterns proven to work well for this band's sound.
  # Record specific formulations that nail the identity, especially when blending genres.
  # Examples:
  #   - "'atmospheric swamp metal accents' — best formulation for keeping band identity when another genre leads"
  #   - "'progressive heavy groove with post-rock dynamics' — captures heaviness without triggering screaming"

# Known Limitations (optional — things Suno can't reliably do for this sound)
known_limitations: []
  # Per-profile list of known limitations or failure modes for this band's genre/style.
  # Saves time by documenting dead ends and workaround-required areas.
  # Examples:
  #   - "Bass-forward rock/metal is not reliably achievable — Suno defaults to guitar-forward mixes"
  #   - "'funk metal' triggers slap/pop bass, not overdriven fingerstyle — avoid this term"
  #   - "Even with 'guitar' in Exclude Styles, Suno still produces guitar in rock/metal context"

# Generation Learnings (optional — what prompt language triggers what behavior)
generation_learnings:
  # Optional — captures what style prompt language triggers what behavior
  # for this specific band's sound. Accumulated from testing and feedback.
  # Examples:
  #   - "'metal' in style prompt triggers screaming — use 'progressive heavy groove' instead"
  #   - "'sludge' triggers harsh vocals — use 'thick, heavy' instead"
  #   - "Weirdness above 60 produces inconsistent results for this genre"

# Generation History (optional — successful generation snapshots)
generation_history: []
# Each entry:
#   - date: "2026-03-19"
#     style_prompt: "the style prompt that worked"
#     model: "v5 Pro"
#     sliders: { weirdness: 65, style_influence: 55 }
#     note: "nailed the vocal tone on this one"

## Notes for Downstream Skills

- **Style Prompt Builder** reads: `style_baseline`, `reference_tracks`, `vocal`, `exclusion_defaults`, `sliders`, `creativity_default`, `model_preference`, `language`, `instrumental`
- **Lyric Transformer** reads: `writer_voice`, `language`
- **Feedback Elicitor** reads: `style_baseline`, `sliders`, `model_preference`; writes to `generation_history` via headless:edit
- When a Persona is active (v4.5/v5), its style auto-populates the Style of Music field — keep additional style modifications simple (1-2 genres, 1 mood, 2-4 instruments max)
- **Persona Era-Anchoring (v4.5/v5):** Personas pull the sound toward the era/style of the source song. Audio Influence at 10-15% reduces this but doesn't eliminate it. For era-specific pieces, generate without a persona or create era-specific personas from era-appropriate source songs.
- **Voices (v5.5):** Voices replace Personas for v5.5. When `voice_id` is set, the Voice defines the vocal identity — omit gender vocal descriptors from `style_baseline`. The style prompt should focus on instrumentation, production, and mood rather than vocal character.
- **v5.5 Voice Gravity Principle (validated April 2026):** v5.5 Voice clones carry **trained genre gravity** — the Voice pulls generations toward its trained baseline on its own. When the target song genre differs from the Voice's trained direction, the style prompt must ACTIVELY FIGHT that gravity, not describe the target. Six practical rules for Voice-aware profiles (see `suno-style-prompt-builder/references/model-prompt-strategies.md` for full details and validated case study):
  1. **Drop descriptors the Voice already delivers** — if the Voice is a folk clone, drop "warm," "vulnerable," "clean," "storytelling vocal" from `style_baseline`. These are wasted characters and can fight the Voice.
  2. **Load descriptors that push AGAINST the Voice's direction** — for a folk Voice doing rock songs, lean hard into "overdriven," "crunch," "driving groove," "rock urgency."
  3. **Keep Style Influence at 65+** so the prompt leads firmly. Profiles with a Voice-genre mismatch should bump `sliders.style_influence` to 65 as the default.
  4. **Leave `vocal.gender` empty** when `voice_id` is set — the schema already warns about this (rule 17).
  5. **Voice-aware `exclusion_defaults`** — when the Voice physically cannot produce harsh vocals, drop `harsh vocals`, `screamed vocals`, etc. from exclusions. Focus exclusions on production/genre-direction protection only (`heavy metal`, `heavy distortion`, `steel guitar`, `autotune`, `pop sheen`). The clean Voice IS the guardrail.
  6. **Audio Influence floor** — use 55-60% as the default for Voice profiles. 30-40% "subtle flavor" only works with Professional-level Voices; non-Professional Voices below 40% trigger robotic timbre.
- **Multi-profile Voice strategy** — profiles can reference multiple Voice IDs when the project uses several Voice recordings (e.g., "Narrative Rock" for mid-tempo rock tracks, "Ballad Intimate" for tender songs, "Speak-Sing Confessional" for literary/narrative tracks). Each Voice should be internally consistent (single stable character, 20-30 sec per recording, Skill Level Professional mandatory). Variety lives across Voices, not within one Voice sample. Document the mapping and per-Voice use cases in the profile.
- **Custom Models (v5.5):** When `custom_model_id` is set, the Style Prompt Builder should complement the model's learned production style rather than fight it. Include `custom_model_notes` context when building prompts.
- **Inspo Playlist Guidance:** Using your own songs as Inspo homogenizes the catalog sound. Drop Inspo when a song needs its own identity within the same band — let the style prompt and persona/voice do the work instead.
