# Band Profile Schema

## YAML Structure

```yaml
# Band Profile — {band_name}
# Created: {date}
# Last modified: {date}

name: "Band Name Here"
version: 1  # Increment on major sound evolution
instrumental: false  # true for instrumental-only projects (skips vocal requirements)

# Sound Identity
genre: "indie folk-rock with electronic textures"
mood: "melancholic but hopeful, atmospheric"
language: "English"  # Language for lyrics and style cues
reference_tracks:
  - "Bon Iver meets Radiohead"
  - "Fleet Foxes with Massive Attack production"

# Model & Tier
model_preference: "v4.5-all"  # v4.5-all | v4 Pro (legacy) | v4.5 Pro | v4.5+ Pro | v5 Pro
tier: "free"                   # free | pro | premier

# Style Prompt — front-load essentials in first 200 chars (critical zone)
style_baseline: >
  Indie folk-rock with electronic textures, atmospheric and layered.
  Warm analog synths underneath acoustic guitar, subtle ambient pads.
  Modern production, wide stereo field, intimate mix.
exclusion_defaults:
  - "no autotune"
  - "no screaming"
  - "no heavy metal guitar"

# Vocal Direction (required unless instrumental: true)
vocal:
  gender: "male"           # male | female | nonbinary | any
  tone: "warm, breathy"
  delivery: "intimate, conversational"
  energy: "restrained, building"
  diction: "clear, slightly slurred on emotional peaks"
  persona_reference: ""    # Suno Persona name, if exists
  persona_source_song: ""  # Song the Persona was derived from (for recreation)
  # NOTE: Personas pull the sound toward the era/style of the source song.
  # Audio Influence at 10-15% reduces this era-anchoring but doesn't fully
  # overcome it. For era-specific pieces, consider generating without a persona,
  # or creating era-specific personas from era-appropriate source songs.

# Creative Settings
creativity_default: "balanced"  # conservative | balanced | experimental

# Sliders (pay-gated — only set if tier supports them)
sliders:
  weirdness: 50            # 0-100, default 50
  style_influence: 50      # 0-100, default 50
  audio_influence: null     # 0-100, only when using audio upload

# Studio Preferences (Premier tier only)
studio_preferences:
  bpm: null                # Default tempo (number)
  key: ""                  # Default key/scale (e.g., "C minor", "A major")
  time_signature: ""       # Default time signature (e.g., "4/4", "3/4")

# Writer Voice (optional — populated by Analyze Writer Voice)
writer_voice:
  vocabulary: ""           # formal/casual, abstract/concrete, domain words
  rhythm: ""               # sentence length patterns, fragment use
  imagery: ""              # dominant image worlds (nature, urban, body, etc.)
  emotional_tone: ""       # raw/restrained, hopeful/melancholic, etc.
  metaphor_style: ""       # extended/quick, conventional/surprising, frequency
  repetition_patterns: ""  # anaphora, refrains, echo structures
  sample_quotes: []        # representative lines from analyzed samples

# Known Working Prompt Patterns (optional — prompt formulations that reliably produce good results)
known_working_patterns: []
  # Per-profile list of prompt patterns proven to work well for this band's sound.
  # Record specific formulations that nail the identity, especially when blending genres.
  # Examples:
  #   - "'atmospheric swamp metal accents' — best formulation for keeping band identity when another genre leads"
  #   - "'progressive heavy groove with post-rock dynamics' — captures heaviness without triggering screaming"

# Known Limitations (optional — things Suno can't reliably do for this sound)
known_limitations: []
  # Per-profile list of known limitations or failure modes for this band's genre/style.
  # Saves time by documenting dead ends and workaround-required areas.
  # Examples:
  #   - "Bass-forward rock/metal is not reliably achievable — Suno defaults to guitar-forward mixes"
  #   - "'funk metal' triggers slap/pop bass, not overdriven fingerstyle — avoid this term"
  #   - "Even with 'guitar' in Exclude Styles, Suno still produces guitar in rock/metal context"

# Generation Learnings (optional — what prompt language triggers what behavior)
generation_learnings:
  # Optional — captures what style prompt language triggers what behavior
  # for this specific band's sound. Accumulated from testing and feedback.
  # Examples:
  #   - "'metal' in style prompt triggers screaming — use 'progressive heavy groove' instead"
  #   - "'sludge' triggers harsh vocals — use 'thick, heavy' instead"
  #   - "Weirdness above 60 produces inconsistent results for this genre"

# Generation History (optional — successful generation snapshots)
generation_history: []
# Each entry:
#   - date: "2026-03-19"
#     style_prompt: "the style prompt that worked"
#     model: "v5 Pro"
#     sliders: { weirdness: 65, style_influence: 55 }
#     note: "nailed the vocal tone on this one"

## Validation Rules

1. `name` must be non-empty
2. `genre` must be non-empty

9. If `instrumental` is true: vocal section is optional; if present, fields are not required
10. If `tier` is "free", `sliders` should not be present or should warn that values won't be usable

12. If `tier` is not "premier" and `studio_preferences` has values, warn they won't be usable
13. If `creativity_default` is present, must be one of: conservative, balanced, experimental

15. `generation_history` must not exceed 10 entries

## Notes for Downstream Skills

- **Style Prompt Builder** reads: `style_baseline`, `reference_tracks`, `vocal`, `exclusion_defaults`, `sliders`, `creativity_default`, `model_preference`, `language`, `instrumental`
- **Lyric Transformer** reads: `writer_voice`, `language`
- **Feedback Elicitor** reads: `style_baseline`, `sliders`, `model_preference`; writes to `generation_history` via headless:edit
- When a Persona is active, its style auto-populates the Style of Music field — keep additional style modifications simple (1-2 genres, 1 mood, 2-4 instruments max)
- **Persona Era-Anchoring:** Personas pull the sound toward the era/style of the source song. Audio Influence at 10-15% reduces this but doesn't eliminate it. For era-specific pieces, generate without a persona or create era-specific personas from era-appropriate source songs.
- **Inspo Playlist Guidance:** Using your own songs as Inspo homogenizes the catalog sound. Drop Inspo when a song needs its own identity within the same band — let the style prompt and persona do the work instead.
