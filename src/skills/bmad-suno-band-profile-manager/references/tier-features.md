## Profile Implications by Tier

**Free tier profiles should:**
- Set `model_preference` to "v4.5-all" (only available model)
- Omit or zero out `sliders` (not available)
- Not reference Personas (not available)
- Focus style_baseline on conversational descriptions (v4.5-all strength)

**Pro tier profiles can:**
- Use any model including v5 Pro
- Set Weirdness and Style Influence sliders
- Reference Suno Personas for vocal consistency
- Use crisp, descriptor-focused style for v5 Pro
- Use Audio Influence slider to manage persona era-anchoring (reduce to 10-15% when the persona's source era conflicts with the desired sound)

**Premier tier profiles can:**
- Everything Pro can do, plus Studio features
- Set studio_preferences (BPM, key, time signature)
- Stems separation for production work
- MIDI export for DAW integration

## Production Notes

**Audio Influence as Era Control (Pro/Premier):** When a persona's era-anchoring conflicts with the desired era for a track, reducing Audio Influence from the default 25% to 10-15% helps pull the sound away from the persona's source era. This doesn't fully eliminate the anchoring — for strong era shifts, consider generating without a persona or creating an era-specific persona from an era-appropriate source song.

**Exclude Styles — Known Limitations:** The Exclude Styles field helps shape tone but does not reliably remove instruments entirely. For example, even with "guitar" in Exclude Styles, Suno still produces guitar in rock/metal contexts. Treat Exclude Styles as a nudge toward the desired balance rather than a hard instrument filter.
