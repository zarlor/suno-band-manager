# Installation Guide

Mac follows the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) open standard. The same SKILL.md files work across multiple LLM CLI tools. Choose the installation path that matches your setup.

## Standalone Installation (Recommended)

Works with any LLM CLI that supports Agent Skills: Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Codex CLI, GitHub Copilot, Windsurf, OpenCode.

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zarlor/bmad-suno-band-manager.git
cd bmad-suno-band-manager
```

### 2. Link skills

```bash
./link-skills.sh
```

This creates symlinks in both `.claude/skills/` and `.agents/skills/`. The `.agents/skills/` path is the portable standard scanned by most LLM CLI tools.

### 3. First-run setup

Activate Mac using your tool's skill invocation. On first run, Mac walks you through setup interactively — Suno tier, interaction mode, preferences. No manual config files needed.

**Claude Code:**
```
/bmad-suno-agent-band-manager
```

**Gemini CLI:**
Activate the `bmad-suno-agent-band-manager` skill via Gemini's skill activation flow.

**Other tools:**
Skills in `.agents/skills/` are auto-discovered at session start. Invoke by name or description match.

### 4. Start creating

Tell Mac what kind of song you want. See the [Usage Guide](USAGE.md) for all features.

## Installation with BMad Method

If you use [BMad Method](https://github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD/) (v6.2.0+), the module integrates with BMad's config management and help system.

### 1. Clone and install BMad

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zarlor/bmad-suno-band-manager.git
cd bmad-suno-band-manager
npx bmad-method@next install
```

### 2. Link skills and run setup

```bash
./link-skills.sh
/bmad-suno-setup
```

The setup skill configures Suno tier, interaction mode, folder paths, and registers capabilities with BMad's help system.

## Tool-Specific Notes

### Claude Code

Primary development and testing platform. Full feature support including:
- Skill invocation via `/bmad-suno-agent-band-manager`
- Sub-agent spawning for parallel skill execution
- Bash tool for Python script execution (validation, analysis)
- Full read/write file access for memory, profiles, songbook

Skills discovered from: `.claude/skills/`, `.agents/skills/`

### Gemini CLI

Skills discovered from: `.agents/skills/`, `.gemini/skills/`

Gemini CLI uses the same SKILL.md format. The skill activates when Gemini identifies a matching task from the skill description. User approval is requested before activation.

If you prefer Gemini's native path, you can additionally symlink into `.gemini/skills/`:
```bash
mkdir -p .gemini/skills
for skill in src/skills/bmad-suno-*/; do
  ln -s "../../$skill" ".gemini/skills/$(basename "$skill")" 2>/dev/null
done
```

### Codex CLI (OpenAI)

Skills discovered from: `.agents/skills/`

Codex uses the same SKILL.md format. Skills can be invoked explicitly via `$skill-name` or through the `/skills` menu.

Custom instructions live in `AGENTS.md` (Codex's equivalent of `CLAUDE.md`). The module does not require an `AGENTS.md` file but you can create one for project-level instructions.

### GitHub Copilot

Skills discovered from: `.agents/skills/`, `.github/skills/`, `.claude/skills/`

Works across Copilot coding agent, Copilot CLI, and VS Code agent mode.

### Windsurf

Skills discovered from: `.agents/skills/`, `.windsurf/skills/`

Activate skills via `@skill-name` in Cascade input.

### OpenCode

Skills discovered from: `.agents/skills/`, `.opencode/skills/`, `.claude/skills/`

OpenCode also supports custom agent definitions in `.opencode/agents/` with granular per-agent tool permissions.

### Cursor

Skills discovered from: `.cursor/skills/` only (does not scan `.agents/skills/`).

Cursor requires skills in its own directory. Copy (don't symlink) if symlinks cause issues:
```bash
mkdir -p .cursor/skills
cp -r src/skills/bmad-suno-* .cursor/skills/
```

Note: Copying means `git pull` won't auto-update Cursor's copies. Re-copy after updates.

### Aider

Aider does not support the Agent Skills format. You can load reference documents manually:
```bash
aider --read SUNO-REFERENCE.md --read USAGE.md
```

This provides Suno context but not the interactive Mac workflow.

---

## Standalone Configuration (without BMad)

When installed standalone (no `_bmad/` directory), Mac uses sensible defaults on first run:
- **Suno tier:** Free (configurable through conversation — "I'm on Pro")
- **Interaction mode:** Demo (configurable — "switch to Studio mode")
- **Band profiles:** `docs/band-profiles/`
- **Songbook:** `docs/songbook/`

All preferences are saved to Mac's memory system and persist across sessions. No manual config file is required.

If you prefer to pre-configure, create `_bmad/config.yaml` and `_bmad/config.user.yaml` manually:

```yaml
# _bmad/config.yaml
document_output_language: English
output_folder: '{project-root}/_bmad-output'
suno:
  name: BMad Suno Band Manager
  version: 1.3.0
  suno_tier: pro          # free, pro, or premier
  default_mode: studio    # demo, studio, or jam
  band_profiles_folder: '{project-root}/docs/band-profiles'
  songbook_folder: '{project-root}/docs/songbook'
```

```yaml
# _bmad/config.user.yaml (gitignored — personal settings)
user_name: Your Name
communication_language: English
```

---

## Updating

```bash
git pull
```

Symlinks point into `src/skills/`, so changes are picked up immediately. If the update includes new config options, Mac will detect them on next activation.

### After a BMad Method upgrade

BMad upgrades may replace `.claude/skills/` contents. Re-run:
```bash
./link-skills.sh
/bmad-suno-setup
```

Your `.agents/skills/` symlinks, config, profiles, songbook, and memory are unaffected.

---

## Optional: Audio Analysis

For objective audio measurements (BPM, key, energy, chord progressions, playlist sequencing):

```bash
pip install librosa numpy
```

Mac will offer to help install these if you try to use audio analysis features without them. The full song creation and refinement workflow works without them.

---

## Troubleshooting

**Skills not discovered:** Verify symlinks exist in the expected directory for your tool. Run `ls -la .agents/skills/` to check.

**Permission denied on link-skills.sh:** Run `chmod +x link-skills.sh` first.

**Python scripts fail:** Ensure Python 3.9+ is available. Mac's scripts use only standard library modules (no pip dependencies except optional librosa/numpy).

**Config not found warnings:** Safe to ignore on standalone installs. Mac uses defaults and discovers preferences through conversation.

**Symlinks not working (Windows):** On Windows without WSL, symlinks may require developer mode or admin privileges. Consider copying skills directly instead of symlinking.
