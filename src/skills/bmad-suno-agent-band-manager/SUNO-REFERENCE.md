## Model Comparison

| Model | Style | Character Limit | Best For | Tier |
|-------|-------|----------------|----------|------|
| **v4.5-all** | Conversational descriptions | 1,000 | Free users, heavier/faster genres, longer songs (~8 min) | Free |
| **v4 Pro** | Simple descriptors | 200 | Straightforward, shorter prompts | Paid |
| **v4.5 Pro** | Conversational descriptions | 1,000 | Intelligent prompts, narrative style | Paid |
| **v4.5+ Pro** | Conversational descriptions | 1,000 | Advanced creation methods | Paid |
| **v5 Pro** | Crisp film-brief (4-7 descriptors) | 1,000 | Authentic vocals, superior audio quality, section editing | Paid |

**Key differences:**
- **v4.5-all** wants flowing, conversational sentences. Example: "Create a melodic, emotional deep house song with organic textures and hypnotic rhythms."
- **v5 Pro** wants crisp descriptors and emotional language over technical. Example: "raw indie folk, yearning vocals, acoustic guitar, lo-fi tape warmth, intimate"
- **v4 Pro** has a hard 200-character limit, not 1,000.

## Style Prompt Best Practices

- **1,000-character limit** (200 for v4 Pro) -- content beyond this is silently truncated
- **Front-load essentials** -- community testing suggests the first ~200 characters carry the strongest influence. Treat this as the "critical zone" where genre, mood, and vocal descriptors must appear.
- **Genre and mood first**, secondary details after
- **Never put artist names in the style prompt** -- Suno does not reliably replicate named artists. Decompose into concrete sonic descriptors instead.
- **Never put sound cues, asterisks, or style descriptions inside lyrics** -- the style prompt and lyrics are separate inputs
- **Negative/exclusion prompts go in the Exclude Styles field**, not in the main style prompt
- **Style prompt sets ONE overall mood** -- it cannot describe a tempo journey ("halftime to double-time" gets averaged). Use metatags in lyrics for section-level changes.
- **Negative prompts are unreliable** -- "no screaming" in the style prompt often gets ignored. Use the Exclude Styles field (Pro/Premier) or translate to positive instructions ("clean singing with grit on peaks").
- **Genre keyword ordering matters** -- front-loaded terms dominate. Whatever appears first sets the primary sound. When a genre should be secondary/flavoring, use "accents" or "undertones": e.g., `atmospheric swamp metal accents`.
- **Genre words trigger specific behaviors** -- "metal" alone triggers screaming, "sludge" triggers harsh vocals, "doom" risks harsh vocals. Always pair heavy genre terms with explicit positive vocal instructions ("clean singing with grit", "raw melodic singing"). Use alternatives ("progressive heavy groove") when screaming is not desired.
- **Style prompt controls the full dynamic arc** -- `slow massive build to crushing climax` makes Suno build ALL the way through, ignoring quiet tags at the end. If the song needs to come down, the style prompt MUST acknowledge the descent: `slow build then fade`, `dynamic shifts loud to quiet`.
- **Rhythm nouns beat tempo adjectives** -- "halftime", "shuffle", "breakbeat" lock feel better than "slow" or "fast".
- **Instrument ordering matters** -- instruments in the first ~200 chars appear globally; instruments at the end of the prompt are more section-specific when reinforced with `[Instrument: ...]` metatags in lyrics.
- **Bass-forward rock/metal is a known limitation** -- Suno cannot reliably produce bass-led sound in rock/metal context. Even "bass and drums only, no guitar" with guitar in excludes still produces guitar. "Funk metal" triggers slap/pop bass (Flea), not overdriven fingerstyle (Geddy Lee).
- **Personas anchor to their source era** -- a persona sourced from a modern song will pull "late 1970s" prompts toward a modern sound. Reduce Audio Influence to 10-15% or generate without a persona for era-specific pieces.

### Exclude Styles (Pro/Premier)

The Exclude Styles field is a dedicated exclusion input separate from the style prompt.

- Format as a **comma-separated list** for easy copy-paste: `screaming vocals, steel guitar, autotune`
- Be specific: "screaming vocals" is better than "screaming"
- Prioritize 2-3 most important exclusions
- With Exclude Styles handling exclusions, the style prompt can focus entirely on POSITIVE instructions
- Heavier genre words ("metal", "sludge") become usable in the style prompt when the Exclude Styles field blocks their unwanted defaults
- **Note:** Exclude Styles is currently in Early Access Beta and may not be 100% reliable for all instrument exclusions

**Free tier:** No Exclude Styles field. Translate exclusion intentions into positive style prompt language -- "clean singing with grit on peaks" instead of "no screaming."

## Metatag Reference

### Section Tags

| Tag | Job |
|-----|-----|
| `[Intro]` | Opening (unreliable -- may need regeneration) |
| `[Verse]` | Setup -- establishes story, scene, or emotion |
| `[Pre-Chorus]` | Lift -- builds tension before the payoff |
| `[Chorus]` | Payoff -- the hook, the memorable part |
| `[Bridge]` | Contrast -- new perspective, musical shift |
| `[Breakdown]` | Strip-down -- reduces instrumentation |
| `[Build-Up]` | Escalation -- increases energy toward a peak |
| `[Final Chorus]` | Closing payoff -- often bigger than earlier choruses |
| `[Outro]` | Resolution -- brings the song to a close |
| `[Instrumental]` | Instrumental section -- no vocals |
| `[Interlude]` | Musical bridge between sections |
| `[Solo]` / `[Guitar Solo]` | Instrumental solo section |
| `[Break]` | Brief pause or stripped-back moment |
| `[Drop]` | Sudden energy release (EDM/electronic) |
| `[Build]` / `[Build-Up]` | Escalation toward a peak |
| `[Hook]` | Short catchy phrase or motif |
| `[Post-Chorus]` | Extends or cools down chorus energy |
| `[Fade Out]` | Gradual volume decrease |

### Descriptor Tags

`[Mood: ...]`, `[Energy: ...]`, `[Vocal Style: ...]`, `[Instrument: ...]`

### Key Rules

- Keep metatag text short: 1-3 words
- Tags at the **top** of lyrics are global; tags **right before** a section are local (and more effective)
- Blank lines between sections improve parsing
- Consistent line lengths and syllable counts improve vocal phrasing stability
- Short repeated hooks sing better than long novel choruses
- Commas create breath pauses; dashes create sharp breaks; ellipses create trailing delivery
- Suno lyrics field has a hard limit of ~3,000 characters (silently truncated)

### Formatting as Suno Controls

- `!` (exclamation) = bark/attack trigger -- bleeds forward into subsequent sections. Avoid in clean/quiet sections.
- ALL CAPS = loudness ceiling -- save for the absolute peak moment only
- `(parentheses)` = backing vocals/texture, not lead melody
- Short lines (1-3 words) = slower delivery; long packed lines = faster delivery (primary tempo control)
- `[Instrument: ...]` before a section specifies instruments for that section -- use to crowd out unwanted instruments rather than trying to exclude them

## Troubleshooting Suno Issues

This table covers problems with Suno's output. For issues with Mac itself (wrong mode, missing profiles, skill errors), see the [Usage Guide Troubleshooting](USAGE.md#9-troubleshooting).

### Prompt and Formatting Issues

| Issue | What Happens | Fix |
|-------|-------------|-----|
| **Silent truncation** | Style prompts over the character limit are cut off without warning | Keep within limits; front-load important content |
| **"Metal" in style prompt** | Triggers screaming/harsh vocals by default | Use "progressive heavy groove" if screaming not desired |
| **Negative prompts ignored** | "No screaming" in style prompt is unreliable | Use Exclude Styles field (Pro) or positive language |
| **Brass/instrument bleed** | Instruments in style prompt appear globally | Move section-specific instruments to end of prompt; use `[Instrument: ...]` metatags |
| **Exclamation points** | `!` triggers bark/attack vocal delivery | Remove from clean sections; bleeds into following sections |
| **ALL CAPS everywhere** | Sets loudness ceiling in early sections | Use sentence case; save caps for one peak moment |
| **Dense punctuation** | Heavy punctuation confuses vocal cadence | Simplify; use commas and dashes intentionally |
| **Scream bleed-through** | Aggressive vocals carry into subsequent sections | Add `[Vocal Style: whispered]` reset after aggressive sections |
| **Sections sound flat despite energy tags** | Energy metatags alone don't drive tempo changes | Combine with line density changes (short lines = slow, packed lines = fast), BPM tags, and Weirdness slider |
| **Persona style conflicts** | Persona's auto-style clashes with your style prompt | Keep additional style modifications simple (1-2 genres, 1 mood, 2-4 instruments max) |
| **Unwanted instrument in wrong section** | Suno's style prompt is global | Move section-specific instruments to end of prompt, use `[Instrument: ...]` metatags, or generate sections separately via Legacy Editor (Pro) |

### Audio Quality Issues

| Issue | What Happens | Fix |
|-------|-------------|-----|
| **Vocal artifacts** | Robotic or glitchy vocals | Try v5 Pro (better vocal nuance), or regenerate |
| **Audio artifacts or glitches** | Random audio issues | Regenerate 3-5 times with the same prompt. If persistent, simplify the style prompt. |
| **Pronunciation issues** | Words sung incorrectly | Add phonetic hints in lyrics or use the `[Spoken Word]` metatag |
| **Timing feels wrong** | Rhythm or pacing issues | Use Warp Markers (v5 Studio, Premier tier) |
| **Long song degradation** | Quality drops in extended generations | Generate shorter segments and use Extend carefully |

### Creative Issues

| Issue | What Happens | Fix |
|-------|-------------|-----|
| **Single generation** | One generation rarely nails it | Always generate 3-5 versions with the same prompt |
| **Same prompt, wildly different results** | Normal Suno behavior | This is expected. Generate 3-5 versions and pick the best. For v5 Pro, results vary more -- that is a feature, not a bug. |
| **Cliche amplification** | Subtle lyrical cliches become obvious when sung | Run cliche detection before submitting lyrics |
| **`[Intro]` unreliability** | Suno's `[Intro]` tag often produces unexpected results | Regenerate just the first 10 seconds, or skip the tag |
| **"Not what I imagined"** | Output doesn't match your vision | Use the Refine Song flow (RS). Mac's feedback elicitation helps you articulate what needs to change. |
